# Krill Publication Client

This module provides two client binaries which can be used to publish objects
at a publication server:

* pubc
* pubc_cms

The first can only be used with a Krill Server, because it relies on a simple JSON
over HTTPS API. The second can be used with publication servers that implement 
RFC8181 and RFC8183.
